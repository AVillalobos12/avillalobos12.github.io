So far I have never used GitHub, so I am a bit unfamiliar with the platform. I do know its for programmers, I have always wanted to open one and learn how to use it. 

The repository seems to be where one would begin to type and create with their prefered coding language.

From what I am understanding is GitHug desktop allows users to code and have access to GitHub a bit more remotely. I can imagine with the desktop feature someone can code with no connection
to the internet and it can update as soon as there is a wifi or direct connect to a intenet source. It also creates backups wherever you choose the root to be. I realized it can even be saved inside of a 
flashdrive if someone so chooses to back it up that way.
